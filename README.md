# Quick About Info
Sheentee is the phonetic spelling of the Irish work síntí, which means "extensions". I created this organisation to begin publishing browser extensions to assist with tasks useful for web application security testing.

The main reason for this is that I use browser extensions on a daily basis, but I don't really have a trust relationship with the extension publishers, and some of the data that passes through extensions are sensitive in nature - so I should, shouldnt I?

Anyway, because of the slight doubt in trust, and the relatively frequent occurrence of browser extensions either being taken over, or simply bought out by malicious actors I thought the best course of action would be to create my own that I can have absolute trust in.

If anyone uses my extensions, and finds this page, know that I never intend to send any content that you pass through my browser extensions anywhere. The data may be stored locally, and may even be made exportable, but it will always be under the absolute control of the user and will never be sent to any endpoint on the internet (or elsewhere) with or without the user's knowledge.
